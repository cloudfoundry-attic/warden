# warden

Manages isolated, ephemeral, and resource controlled environments.

## Introduction

The project's primary goal is to provide a simple API for managing
isolated environments. These isolated environments -- or _containers_ --
can be limited in terms of CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and
network access. As of writing, the only supported OS is Linux.

## Components

This repository contains the following components:

* `warden` -- server
* `warden-protocol` -- protocol definition, used by both the server and clients
* `warden-client` -- client (Ruby)
* `em-warden-client` -- client (Ruby's EventMachine)

For information on how to run the warden server and interact with it
at the command line, see the [warden server README](warden/README.md).

## Testing

[warden-test-infrastructure](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/warden-test-infrastructure) provides a way to create a vagrant box and run warden tests.

```
# Checkout the repos
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/warden
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/warden-test-infrastructure

# Create a vagrant box
pushd warden-test-infrastructure && git submodule update --init && ./create_vagrant_box.sh && popd

# Run warden tests
export FOLDER_NAME=
pushd warden && ../warden-test-infrastructure/ci-build
```
